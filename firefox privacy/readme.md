The **user.js** file in Firefox is an _optional configuration_ file that lets you set or override **Firefox preferences** (especially for privacy, security, performance, etc.). This file must be placed inside your Firefox user profile folder.
_______________________________________________________________________
**Typical paths:**
- **Windows**: C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\<profile_name>\user.js
- **Linux**: /home/<YourUsername>/.mozilla/firefox/<profile_name>/user.js
- **macOS**: /Users/<YourUsername>/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/<profile_name>/user.js

Replace _<profile_name>_ with your actual Firefox profile folder name (usually something like xxxxxxx.default-release).
_______________________________________________________________________
Or you can do this:
1. **Open** Firefox.
2. Go to: **about:support** in the address bar.
3. Look for the **Profile Folder** entry.
4. Click "**Open Folder**".
5. **Copy** the **user.js** file into that folder.

You can use **my file** or you can download **user.js** file from these **repositories**:

1. https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/
2. https://github.com/spikecodes/peafox

-  **Arkenfox** if you're looking for **maximum protection** and detailed control over every aspect. It's **frequently updated**, with strong community support and an in-depth wiki.
-  **Peafox** if you want a **quick setup** focused on disabling predictors and prefetching, with a **good balance** between privacy and usability.

_If you want to change settings on your own, you should remove these user.js files, or you could create one with your own settings._
